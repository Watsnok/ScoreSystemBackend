Backend for basic score system.

Technologies: Java, Java Spring Boot

The following features were implemented:

-Person can be added with a name and score

-Can look up person with a unique id created with UUID

-Can update Name and score on a user

-Can delete a person

-List can be sorted to descending order


The features are not available on a working HTML site.
Instead I tested the features by sending requests through the program Postman.
